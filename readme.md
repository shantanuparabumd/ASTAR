### Student Name
- Shantanu Parab
- Vineet Singh

### Student ID
- sparab@umd.edu
- vsingh03@umd.edu

## Libraries used are: 
>numpy, argparse, timeit, queue, OpenCV, math 

## Source Code Files
- [`astar3.py`](astar3.py) - Contains the implementation of Dijkstra algorithm to solve the path planning problem.
  + The program will run a dijkstra algorithm for path planning and create a video. This video will be outputted in the end.
  + Once the program runs  completetly it will show  a image output of optimum path.
  + Press enter once the image is shown this will complete the video recording
  + The program will ask the user to give the inputs for start and goal and check wheter it is valid

Note: The output video is created as Astar01.avi which is converted to mp4 using another software.


## How to Run the Program:
To run the program, open the command prompt/terminal and navigate to the directory where the source code files are located. Then, type the following command: 

    python3 astar3.py --InitState 50 125 --GoalState 430 230 --StepSize 10 --RobotClearance 5
